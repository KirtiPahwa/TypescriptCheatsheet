1.Typescript is a superset of javascript . Means any valid javascript code is also valid Typescript code.
2.But Typescript has additional features that donot exist in current version of javascript.
3. Example..,.Strong typing(has to define type with variable),Object-Oriented features added like classes ,interfaces, constructors,public,private modifiers,
Compile-time errors(easier in fetching the error at compile time),Great tooling ().
4.Browser doesnot understand Typescript. So we need to compile or transpile into javascript code ,i.e., building a application. Whenever
we build a application Typescript compiler compile/transpile code into javascript and then browser can run the javascript code.
5. To install typescript : npm install -g typescript (globally)
6. tsc --version : to check version of typescript.
7. Files saved with .ts extension
8. To transpile file into javascript use: tsc filename.ts
9. In frameworks  , no need to transpile javascript code explicitly
10. We can run this code using :node filename.ts
11. When we transpile typescript code, it makes a separate file for javascript code
